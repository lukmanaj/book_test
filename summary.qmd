## Why Python? Why not R?

This book will be helpful in making others learn programming. It will be straight to point and avoid jargons as much as possible. I begin with a long time controversy about the best language to use as a data scientist, Python or R. I have used both and I will attempt to highlight the strengths and unavoidably the weaknesses each language possess.

Syntax-wise, Python has no rival. Consider the examples below:

Python example of if-else

```{python}
c = 7
if c >5:
  print(True)
else:
  print(False)
```

R example, just look at the braces, oh

```{r}
c <- 7
if (c > 5) {
  print(TRUE)
} else {
  print(FALSE)
}

```

Syntax-wise, Python is the clear-cut winner as it is more readable for a regular human.
