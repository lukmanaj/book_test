# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book.

I was motivated to begin this by a mentor and I will say this is a plus to me. I am so happy I got the opportunity to actually begin this. So happy.

```{python}
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(5)
```

I began properly learning Python in February this year and I have come so far. This is why, I believe it is time, I work with my mentor to share what I have learnt so far with others. It may be beneficial, we never can tell.

Let's illustrate how I can randomly select one out of many options from a list:

```{python}
import random
name_list = ['Lukman','Musa','Sani','Zubair']
random.choice(name_list)
```

In this simple illustration, a name was randomly selected from the name_list. If I run the code again, I could get another name. We can easily use this to randomly select the person who gets to empty the bin. Lol.

This gives an idea of what to expect in this book.
